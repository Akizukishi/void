## Problems

This is an attempt to address several cognitive defects.

1. frequently fall out of creative flow
1. day-to-day work lacks coherence
1. failure to integrate learnings into a cohesive perspective
1. execution of tasks lacks focus and motivation
1. unclear how my efforts are impacting goals

## Perspectives

* things we measure tend to improve
* we should minimize decisions to prevent fatigue
* we should regularly reevaluate priorities
* flexible cores can be bent to many uses

## Implementation

* everything is a tree
* you can collapse subtrees
* you can drill-down the screen focus arbitrarily
* trees of tasks can be marked with `#task`, all children of marked nodes are implicitly subtasks
* tasks can be prioritized with `#prio=<n>`, all children implicitly inherit the lowest ancestor's priority
* a task can be chosen automatically, with priorities weighting a random selection. you should delete it or do it, don't get into the habit of drawing again until you see something you like.  you chose the priorities, and you should keep them up-to-date.
* completed subtasks for a particular view are plotted on a sparkline at the top of the screen for the past week. this will become dramatically more flexible in the future.
* you can draw arrows between nodes for mind-mapping functionality

#### install

`cargo install voidmap`

if you don't have cargo, an easy way to get and manage
it is [via rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/).

#### invocation


`void`

this attempts to use `$HOME/.void.db` as a storage file.
if you'd like to specify a different storage file:

`void [/path/to/savefile]`

#### keys

feature | control | feature | control
--- | --- | --- | ---
new node | C-n | new node (child of selected) | Tab
new node (freeform) | click blank space | new node (sibling of selected) | Enter
delete selected node and its children | Delete | move subtree | drag parent to new location
arrange nodes in view | C-p | auto-arrange nodes in view from now on | C-z
mark selected node complete | C-a | drill-down into selected node | C-w
pop up selection | C-q | hide children of selected | C-t
open text editor for `txt:...` node | C-k | prefix-jump with no selection | type a letter
prefix-jump with other selected | C-f | hide completed children of node | C-h
select arrow start/destination | C-r | erase arrow | select start, C-r, then destination, C-r
show debug log | C-l | reparent node | drag node to new parent
scroll up | PgUp | scroll down | PgDn
select up | Up | select down | Down
select subtree to left | Left | select subtree to right | Right
de-select node | Esc | save | C-x
exit | Esc with nothing selected | exit | C-c
jump to weighted next task | C-v

can be customized by setting the `KEYFILE` env var to the path of a [key configuration file](default.keys)

#### known bugs

doesn't properly handle very long text. if you want to embed
an essay, create a node that begins with `txt: ` and hit `C-k`
to open its contents in an external text editor, specifiable
by setting the `EDITOR` env var.

#### optional configuration

setting the `LOGFILE` environment variable will allow you to
log debugging info to a file.

setting the `EDITOR` environment variable will allow you to
specify which text editor is opened when hitting `C-k` on a
node whose name begins with `txt: `.  defaults to vim.

setting the `KEYFILE` environment variable to the path of a
[keyfile](default.keys) allows you to customize the controls

setting the `LOCATION_QUERY` environment variable to anything
will enable an http request that is sent out at startup to
get approximate latitude and longitude coordinates associated
with your internet-facing IP. this is added to any nodes created
during a session, and eventually will allow you to trace the
rough path you've taken over time. aimed mostly at users who
travel a lot, may eventually have a more interesting implementation.

#### notes

This came about in the midst of an (ongoing) obsessive inquiry into a
cluster of topics roughly related to "effectiveness" while stumbling
through various mountain ranges and cities in central europe and the
american northeast.

> The primary thing when you take a sword in your
hands is your intention to cut the enemy, whatever
the means. Whenever you parry, hit, spring, strike
or touch the enemyâ€™s cutting sword, you must cut
the enemy in the same movement. It is essential to
attain this. If you think only of hitting, springing,
striking or touching the enemy, you will not be able
actually to cut him. More than anything, you must
be thinking of carrying your movement through to
cutting him. ...When you appreciate the power of
nature, knowing the rhythm of any situation, you
will be able to hit the enemy naturally and strike
naturally. All this is the Way of the Void.
-Miyamoto Musashi
